# oxhq/pliego-laravel

Laravel 13 integration for application-owned Blade documents.

```sh
composer require oxhq/pliego-laravel:^0.2.0
php artisan pliego:install
php artisan pliego:doctor
```

Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 needs `ca-certificates`, `libfontconfig1`, `libegl1`, and
`libgl1-mesa-dri`. Headless containers also need a writable mode-0700
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; no display server or Xvfb is required.
Windows x64 requires the latest
[Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
macOS Intel and Apple Silicon bundles require macOS 13 or newer. The Intel
binary is unsigned and Apple Silicon is ad-hoc signed; neither is Developer ID
signed or notarized.

The Laravel package installs the PHP bridge as its dependency. `pliego:install`
selects the pinned runtime for Linux x64, Windows x64, or macOS Intel/Apple
Silicon, verifies its size and SHA-256, and installs it under
`storage/app/pliego-runtime`.

Set `PLIEGO_RUNTIME_DIR` to move the managed directory. `PLIEGO_BINARY` is an
explicit override for system packages and air-gapped deployments; unset it when
testing managed installation.

## Rendering a Blade view

The default render path is:

```php
use Pliego\Laravel\Facades\Document;

return Document::view('invoice', compact('rows'))->download();
```

Add locale, resource policy, and local assets only when the view needs them:

```php
use Pliego\Laravel\Facades\Document;

return Document::view('invoice', ['rows' => $rows])
    ->locale('es-MX')
    ->timezone('PST8PDT')
    ->denyNetwork()
    ->asset('fonts/invoice.woff2', resource_path('fonts/invoice.woff2'))
    ->download('invoice.pdf');
```

Static Blade views need no readiness calls. Pliego infers readiness after page load
and waits for `document.fonts.ready`. Call `defer()` only when JavaScript continues
changing the document or a canvas after load, then finish with `ready()` or
`fail()`:

```html
<script>
window.pliego?.defer();
loadReportData()
    .then(drawReport)
    .then(() => window.pliego?.ready())
    .catch(error => window.pliego?.fail(error.message));
</script>
```

Chart.js 4.5.1 is covered for a fixed, non-animated chart that performs a
synchronous full-canvas `getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)` readback
after its final draw and before `ready()`. The retained pixels become the
authoritative canvas result; other versions, modes, plugins, and Canvas APIs are not
implied.

`render()` and `download()` reject partial scene capture instead of returning a PDF
with unsupported paint omitted. Retained artifacts remain available on the typed
exception.

PDF paint retains resolved sRGB text colors, solid backgrounds, uniform-color sharp
axis-aligned solid borders, and uniform solid collapsed-table borders. CSS
gradients and background-image layers, box and text shadows, text decorations,
rounded or mixed-color borders, clips, non-solid and image borders, transforms,
opacity, filters, and blend modes are explicitly unsupported and reported rather
than approximated.

Blade is rendered first. The package creates a private input directory, copies only
declared relative assets, records their hashes, and launches one `pliego render`
process with explicit locale, timezone, page geometry, and resource policy.
`download()` returns a Laravel file response; `render()` returns the PDF,
input-bundle, and retained-artifact paths.

For Google Fonts, keep the stylesheet `<link>` in the Blade view and allow both
origins:

```php
$pdf = Document::view('invoice')
    ->allowHttpRoot('https://fonts.googleapis.com/')
    ->allowHttpRoot('https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/')
    ->render();
```

## Failures and retained evidence

Catch `Pliego\Php\Exception\RenderException` for typed failures. The
exception preserves the engine code, process exit code, stderr, and retained input
and artifact paths. Failed renders do not publish a final PDF.

Successful jobs are retained for one day and failed jobs for seven days by default.
Preview or apply cleanup with:

```sh
php artisan pliego:prune --dry-run
php artisan pliego:prune
```
