# oxhq/pliego-laravel

Laravel 13 integration for rendering application-owned Blade views as PDFs with
Pliego's native runtime.

```sh
composer require oxhq/pliego-laravel:^0.1.0-alpha.3 oxhq/pliego-php:^0.1.0-alpha.2
php artisan pliego:install
php artisan pliego:doctor
```

Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 needs `ca-certificates`, `libfontconfig1`, `libegl1`, and
`libgl1-mesa-dri`. Headless containers also need a writable mode-0700
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; no display server or Xvfb is required.
Windows x64 requires the latest
[Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
macOS Intel and Apple Silicon bundles require macOS 13 or newer. The Intel
binary is unsigned and Apple Silicon is ad-hoc signed; neither is Developer ID
signed or notarized.

Both Composer constraints are explicit so applications do not need to change their
global minimum stability. `pliego:install` selects the pinned runtime for Linux
x64, Windows x64, or macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, verifies its size and SHA-256, and
installs it under `storage/app/pliego-runtime`.

Set `PLIEGO_RUNTIME_DIR` to move the managed directory. `PLIEGO_BINARY` is an
explicit override for system packages and air-gapped deployments; unset it when
testing managed installation.

## Render a Blade view

```php
use Pliego\Laravel\Experimental\Facades\Document;

return Document::view('invoice', ['rows' => $rows])
    ->pageSize('612x792')
    ->margins('36,36,36,36')
    ->locale('es-MX')
    ->timezone('PST8PDT')
    ->denyNetwork()
    ->asset('fonts/invoice.woff2', resource_path('fonts/invoice.woff2'))
    ->download('invoice.pdf');
```

Blade is rendered first. The package creates a private input directory, copies only
declared relative assets, records their hashes, and launches one `pliego render`
process with explicit locale, timezone, page geometry, and resource policy.

## Google Fonts and live assets

Offline assets are the reproducible default. For Google Fonts, keep the stylesheet
`<link>` in the Blade view and allow both origins:

```php
$pdf = Document::view('invoice')
    ->allowHttpRoot('https://fonts.googleapis.com/')
    ->allowHttpRoot('https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/')
    ->render();
```

## Failures and retained evidence

Catch `Pliego\Php\Experimental\Exception\RenderException` for typed failures. The
exception preserves the engine code, process exit code, stderr, and retained input
and artifact paths. Failed renders do not publish a final PDF.

Successful jobs are retained for one day and failed jobs for seven days by default.
Preview or apply cleanup with:

```sh
php artisan pliego:prune --dry-run
php artisan pliego:prune
```
